Feature: Item Buying

  Scenario: Test Case 3 - Buy products, proceed to checkout, and verify price correctness
    Given I am in Home page
    When I navigate to Shop page
    And I buy the following items:
      | ItemName       | Quantity  |
      | Stuffed Frog   | 2         |
      | Fluffy Bunny   | 5         |
      | Valentine Bear | 3         |
    And I navigate to Cart page
    Then the price and subtotal value for each product is correct
      | ItemName       | Quantity  | AmountPerItem | SubtotalValue |
      | Stuffed Frog   | 2         | $10.99        | $21.98        |
      | Fluffy Bunny   | 5         | $9.99         | $49.95	       |
      | Valentine Bear | 3         | $14.99        | $44.97	       |
    And the grand total value is equal to '$116.9'
